# About
The Cutback is a web application which connects social and trading aspects. This project is built to help surfers trade their gear and encourage them to use second-hand equipment. Users can create posts with a gear they want to sell, but also compare products by the comments and 5-star rating system. All they need to do is create an account with an existing email. With an authorised profile, they are ready to help save our planet by taking part in a reusable community.

## Project Goals
1. Build a project to trade second-hand surfing equipment.
2. Help users to choose the best product they are interested in.
3. Create a platform with easy access to products.
4. Design a layout that is intuitive and focuses on content.
5. Allow for responsiveness on different screen sizes to reach a further audience.
6. Target multinational users to increase the app's reach.
7. Require an account for posting offers to avoid fraudsters.
8. Increase offers reliability with the use of visual data.
9. Give users quick access to the best offers.
10. Create a platform for modern needs.
11. Allow users to filter products by useful features.
12. Give users the ability to vote and comment on the products.

# Project Architecture
<!-- Document the reuse of components -->

# UX Design
<!-- The main theme of the application is designed to be toned, thus it gives a great contrast with elements of brighter colours requiring attention. The principle of the design is to bring a minimalistic approach to the page. -->
## Color Scheme
<!-- The colour scheme is based on pastel colours with the use of bold colours to bring the user's attention. -->

## Typography
<!-- The primary font used for the application is Inter. The logo and big headings use Karla font. Together they give great contrast but also transition smoothly between one another.  -->
All fonts come from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
