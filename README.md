# **About**

The Cutback is a web application which allows users to compare surfing equipment and to find the best deal for themselves. This project is built to help surfers trade their gear and encourage them to use second-hand equipment. Users can create posts with a gear they want to sell, but also compare products by the comments and 5-star rating system. All they need to do is create an account with an existing email. With an authorised profile, they are ready to help save our planet by taking part in a reusable community.

# **Technologies Used**

- ### Languages

  - [JS](https://www.javascript.com/): the primary language used to develop interactive components of the website.

  - [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css): the styling language used to style the website.

  - [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/): was used for building user interface
  - [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/): was used as a supprotive toolkit for front-end styling.

- ### Front-End Libraries

  - [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/): was used for handling differnt URLs rendering different pages. React Router allows for rendering pages inside Virtual DOM stopping the page from refreshing. This enhances UX.
  - [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/): was used for testing API requests. With this tool the test server is created mocking the API requests, so that the real API request is not triggered.
  - [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/): was used to inject CSS styling directly to component.
    - No hunt across different files to find the styling affecting your component.
    - Styled compoenents are independent of each other.
    - Remove unused styles, even if they're declared in the code.
    - Styled components generates unique class names for your styles.

- ### Other tools

  - [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/): was used for testing API requests.
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/): the version control system used to manage the code.
  - [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/): the hosting service used to host the website.
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/): used to host the website's source code.
  - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): the IDE used to develop the website.
  - [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/): was used to debug the website.
  - [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/): was used to create the icons used in the website.
  - [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/): was used to design wireframes during the design process.
  - [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/): was used to validate HTML5 code for the website.
  - [W3C CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/): was used to validate CSS code for the website.
  - [JShint](https://jshint.com/): was used to validate JS code for the website.
  - [Coolorc.co](https://coolors.co/): was used to choose pallete colors for website
  - [CSSgradient.io](https://cssgradient.io/): was used for genertating background gradients
  - [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/): was used to check grammar and typo errors.

# **Project Architecture**
<!-- Document the reuse of components -->
1. **The project files structure.**

   Files organization is inspired by [Spectrum](https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum/)'s code base, where [Max Stoiber](https://github.com/mxstbr), the creator of styled-components, contributes heavily on this project.

# **UX Design**

<!-- The main theme of the application is designed to be toned, thus it gives a great contrast with elements of brighter colours requiring attention. The principle of the design is to bring a minimalistic approach to the page. -->
## Color Scheme
<!-- The colour scheme is based on pastel colours with the use of bold colours to bring the user's attention. -->

## Typography

- The primary font used for the application is **Montserrat** - it is modern and elegant font-family used on most of the website.
- The font-family used for the logo is **Permanent Marker** - it gives contrast to primary font-family.

All fonts come from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

## Wireframes

 Wireframes used in the design process can be found [here](documentation/wireframes/cutback-wireframes.pdf). The deployed version of the site is not the exact representation of the wireframes due to time management or technical issues.
